# Luck-25
I have created a dice rolling game called “Lucky 25”, which is 2 or 3 players. The users are greeted with the rules of the game at the very start. The goal of the game is to roll a set of two dies, every time you roll the dice the total of both dice combined is added to your previous roll. You as the player want to get as close as possible to 25 or exactly 25. I have also added a feature in which if the die is equal to each other in one of your rolls you are given the option to reroll or keep your roll. Once you get as close to 25 as you are satisfied with you may end your turn and the next player is prompted to go. If you hit exactly 25 you automatically win unless somebody else ties you. In the end whoever is closest to 25 without going over wins the game.
